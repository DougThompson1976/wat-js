- Global handling when running in Node is sort of broken

- $setTimeout is undefined in Node, probably because we get passed the
  wrong global object by browserify

- comments aren't properly parsed and evaluate to null

- wat:
(define x 1)
(define exports (list x))
(log (eval (list* module (list* list x) exports) (get-current-environment)))
gives prompt not found

* Wat Programming Language

/Wat/ is an ultra-lightweight dialect of Lisp, specifically Kernel, in
which everything is first-class: syntax, control, and data.  Syntax is
based on lexically-scoped fexprs and first-class environments,
subsuming ordinary procedures and hygienic macros.  Control is based
on delimited continuations and tail-call elimination, subsuming all
computational effects.  Data uses a dynamic type-tagging system that
allows generic programming over built-in as well as user-defined data
types.

* The Wat Programming Language

/Wat/ is an ultra-lightweight dialect of Lisp, specifically Kernel, in
which everything is first-class: expression, control, and data.
Expression is based on lexically-scoped fexprs and first-class
environments, subsuming ordinary procedures and hygienic macros.
Control is based on first-class continuations and tail-call
elimination, subsuming all known control structures.  Data uses a
dynamic type-tagging system that allows generic programming over
built-in as well as user-defined data types.
